# ArgentSea for SQL Server

ArgentSea is a revolutionary platform for building .NET data applications with great supportability, high performance, and massive scalability.


The framework offers configuration, resilience, and mapping functionality that is useful for *any* data application. The framework is differentiated, however, by its support for data “sharding” — which is the practice of spreading a single data set across multiple servers. It is a cost effective way to grow to Internet scale.
